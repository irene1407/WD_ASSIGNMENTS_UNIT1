	<p>Life has been bestowed upon us by the almighty and we all must value it. We should be thankful for all that we have and try to improve ourselves each day to build a better life. Technically, life is associated with feelings, growth and evolution. Like the plants have life because they grow; humans and animals have life as they feel sadness, happiness and they too grow.<br></p>
<p> The problems and concerns of people are genuine. The rich, the poor, the educated, the uneducated, the beautiful and the not so beautiful â€“ everyone has his/ her on set of problems. Life is not easy for anyone. However, we need to understand that this is how life is. If everything came easy we would not really value it. Life is beautiful in its own way and we should look for reasons to enjoy it and embrace its beauty amid the issues we are dealing with.
