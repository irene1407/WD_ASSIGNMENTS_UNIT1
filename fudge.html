    <h1>FUDGE</h1>
    <p>The term fudge is said to have originated in the 17th century from the verb fadge and means "to fit together in a clumsy manner".<br> During this period, fudge was used as an interjection by sailors to respond to nonsense or untruths.

        Fudge as a confection gained traction in the United States during the late 19th century; recipes for fudge were printed in many periodicals and advertisements during the 1880s. Its inexpensive, unrefined qualities made it popular among people looking for an alternative that fell between expensive candies and the cheapest sweets. Specialized fudge shops began opening in tourist places such as Mackinac Island, Michigan, in 1887. The increase in fudge's popularity was partly due to the accessibility of its production process: ordinary people were able to make it in their homes without any specialized equipment. In addition, the cost of refined white sugar had been decreasing at the time, cutting production costs.</p>
