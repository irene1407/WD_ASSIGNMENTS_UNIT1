	<h2>What is Easter</h2>
<p><b>Easter is just a hop around the corner – with millions of people around the world are preparing to celebrate this Sunday.</b>
</p>
<p>The Christian holiday commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. While traditions and religious rituals for Easter vary among denominations and  across the globe, many Christians observe the holiday through church services and prayer.
Meanwhile, others may also be anticipating a visit from a magical Easter Bunny – or preparing for a weekend full of colorful eggs, baskets of chocolate and more.

	<h2> History </h2>
<p>"Easter's roots (date back to) a day in the week in which Christ rose from the dead. It would have been the first day of the week after the Jewish Sabbath, which was 	Saturday," Timothy P. O’Malley, a faculty member at the University of Notre Dame's McGrath Institute for Church Life, told USA TODAY.
</p>
<p><i>"Early Christians celebrated, therefore, every Sunday like it was Easter.</i> There was no annual commemoration of Easter early on, but by the second and third centuries, there 	comes to be an annual celebration of Easter," O'Malley continued, adding that the celebration later grew.

	<h2>Easter Eggs</h2>
<p>From a Christian perspective,<b> the egg represents the resurrection of Jesus</b>. The first book to mention Easter eggs by name was written 500 years ago. Yet, a North African tribe that had become Christian much earlier had a custom of coloring eggs at Easter. 
</p>
<p>Long hard winters often meant little food, and a fresh egg for Easter was quite a prize. A notation in the household accounts of Edward I of England showed an expenditure of eighteen pence for 450 eggs to be gold-leafed and colored for Easter gifts.
